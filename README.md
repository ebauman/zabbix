I work on things in Zabbix, like templates, and scripts, and so on.
This is a place to put those things, and share them with the world at large.


##### Scripts/PrinterAutodiscover.ps1 #####

This is used for low-level autodiscovery of printers on a Windows OS. The output of this Powershell script is a JSON object, containing the list of all printers added to the OS, formatted suitable for low-level discovery use.
